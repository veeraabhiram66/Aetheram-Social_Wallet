# ✅ WALLET SESSION PERSISTENCE - IMPLEMENTED!

## What Was Fixed
Your wallet connection will now **persist across sessions** until you manually disconnect!

## How It Works

### 🔄 **Auto-Reconnect on Page Load**
- When you refresh the page or open a new tab, the wallet automatically reconnects
- No need to click "Connect Wallet" again and again
- Uses the same account you connected before

### 💾 **Session Storage**
- Connection state saved in browser's localStorage
- Remembers your account address
- Cleared only when you click "Disconnect" or change accounts in MetaMask

### 🎯 **Smart Restoration**
- Checks if MetaMask still has the same account available
- Automatically restores connection if valid
- Falls back gracefully if account changed or unavailable

## Visual Indicators

### ✅ **When Connected**
- Shows "📌 Auto-reconnect" badge in wallet header
- Indicates session persistence is active

### 🔄 **On Page Load**
- Brief loading state while restoring connection
- Console logs show restoration process

## User Experience

### **Before (Old Behavior):**
1. Connect wallet ✅
2. Refresh page ❌ (disconnected)
3. Connect again ❌ (annoying)
4. Repeat every session ❌

### **After (New Behavior):**
1. Connect wallet once ✅
2. Refresh page ✅ (stays connected)
3. Open new tab ✅ (stays connected)
4. Close browser ✅ (stays connected)
5. Only disconnects when YOU choose ✅

## Technical Implementation

### **Frontend Changes:**
- `useWallet.js`: Added session persistence logic
- `walletService.js`: Added `restoreConnection()` method
- `WalletHeader.js`: Added auto-reconnect indicator

### **Storage Keys:**
- `wallet_connected`: Boolean flag
- `wallet_account`: Last connected account address

### **Security:**
- Only restores if MetaMask has same account
- Clears data on manual disconnect
- Handles account changes gracefully

## Console Logs to Watch For

### **On Page Load:**
```
🔄 Checking wallet session: { wasConnected: true, lastAccount: "0x..." }
🔄 Attempting to restore wallet session...
✅ Wallet session restored successfully
```

### **On Connect:**
```
✅ Wallet session saved to localStorage
```

### **On Disconnect:**
```
🔄 Wallet session cleared from localStorage
```

## Testing

### **To Test Session Persistence:**
1. Connect your wallet
2. Refresh the page → Should auto-connect
3. Open new tab → Should auto-connect
4. Close browser, reopen → Should auto-connect
5. Click "Disconnect" → Should clear session
6. Refresh page → Should NOT auto-connect (back to connect button)

### **To Test Account Changes:**
1. Connect with Account A
2. Change to Account B in MetaMask
3. Session should update to Account B automatically

## 🎉 **Result**
**No more annoying wallet reconnections every session!**
**One-time connect, persistent across all browser sessions!**
